# Movie Trailer Website
## Info
This is my submission for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer nanodegree's Movie Trailer Website project. I wrote server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. I then used this code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.
